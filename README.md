# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

This repository, **fcc-js-algorithms-tasks**, contains the projects and tasks I am completing as part of the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification. Each project demonstrates my understanding and application of fundamental algorithms and data structures using JavaScript.

I am currently working on these projects to complete the FreeCodeCamp certification. Stay tuned for updates!

Happy coding! ðŸ˜„
